GGJ 2014 game!

By nihilocrat, Geoffrey Cooper, Francis Sheridan ParÃ©


== Setup ==
Stretch the window so that it spread on both monitor. Each player should only see his own half of the game.

Player 1 (the walker) should see the left side and have the keyboard and mouse.

Player 2 (the mime) should see the right side. The mime has no controls, but he'll get to see the traps and invisible walls.

The mime helps the walker to navigate to the exit (the tall pink tube) but remember: no talking allowed! :)


== Mac users troubleshoot ==

-> I can't launch the game! Solution: Right click the app, select Open, then click the Open button

-> I can't strech the window on my second monitor or the window doesn't stay visible on the other monitor! Solution: Go in System Preference > Mission Control and unckeck the box that says "Displays have separate Spaces". You'll have to reboot the computer. And after playing the game, you'll probably want to go back in there and check that box again.
