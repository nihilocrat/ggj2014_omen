== Mac users troubleshoot ==

-> I can't launch the game!
Solution: Right click the app, select Open, then click the Open button

-> I can't strech the window on my second monitor or the window doesn't stay visible on the other monitor!
Solution: Go in System Preference > Mission Control and unckeck the box that says "Displays have separate Spaces". You'll have to reboot the computer. And after playing the game, you'll probably want to go back in there and check that box again.
